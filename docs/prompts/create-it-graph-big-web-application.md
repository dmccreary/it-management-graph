    Use the it-graph-generator to create a new  microsim called `web-app-arch'.  
    This microsim must show all of the servers in a high volume web application with a database back end.  
    The user nodes connect to a firewall.  
    The firewall connects to a load-balancer.  
    The load balancer connects to 3 web servers.  
    Each web server connects to a database.  The databases are all connected to a synchronization server.
