# Book Metrics Report

!!! prompt
    Please look at the python program at /src/site-metrics/get-ibook-metrics.py.  
    This is a very old program.  It runs, but it does not reflect the structure of this new book.  
    Please update the metrics program to get metrics more relevant to this book like: 
        1. number of chapters
        1. sections per chapter
        1. <details>
        1. concepts
        1. glossary 
        1. terms etc.

    Run the report into a new file called /docs/book-metrics.md and add this file 
    to the mkdocs.yml after the glossary.
